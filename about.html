    <p>Currently I am an audio engineer with 5+ years of experience looking to make a switch into the tech industry. 
        I've always been interested in tech and am now pursuing that passion more professionally. 
        After many years working in the music industry I have started to notice flaws in the softwares I have to use daily. 
        This has ignited my curiosity for software development. With a new passion for making programs more efficient and user friendly, 
        I started the Java Developer Bootcamp through Grand Circus in March of 2022. Although I am still in school, this program has 
        already given me the opportunity to grow my technical skills in Java, HTML, and CSS while working individually and with a team. 
        I love the sense of satisfaction I get when I complete a tough project. I believe my past experiences as an audio engineer mixed
         with my education through Grand Circus will allow me to one day be a every effective software developer.
        When I'm not in class or working I enjoy camping, hiking, running, and playing/writing music. I often have shows in the Metro 
        Detroit Area with the many bands I play guitar for.</p>
